### Description
This is a three-column layout.

### Usage
A three-column layout is ideal for a full-width page where three items have equal importance. This should not be used to display the text of an article, and can look compressed on a page with a sidebar already in place. Content in a three-columned area should be brief and use consistent styling across all three columns. It is most effective when combined with other content formats, such as two-column or full-width.

### Accessibility Considerations
There are no specific requirements for accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
