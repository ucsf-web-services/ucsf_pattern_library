# Animation Examples

## Description
Use the animation section to contain shared client-end "animated" interactions with content used across the site. The naming "Animation" was adopted from the implementation at UCD and it seemed to fit pretty well within the UCSF component naming structure. Good candidates for this section are sliders, timelines, and other structured sectional content within the page. Note, this is not the same as programmatic list results, such as teasers or cards that are in other component sections. 

## Usage
Animations should be applied consistently across the site to maintain a comprehensive user experience.
