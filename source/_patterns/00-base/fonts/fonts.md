### Description
These are the brand-approved fonts for UCSF.

### Usage
Helvetica Neue and Granjon are UCSF's primary typefaces. For font licenses questions, contact <a href="mailto:identity@ucsf.edu">identity@ucsf.edu</a>. Information on best practices and examples of incorrect usage are available on Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/brand-guide/fonts">Font/Typography page</a>.

Arial and Garamond should only be used when our primary typefaces cannot be procured.

### Accessibility Considerations
Use the most readable fonts. Limit the number of fonts. Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.  Use relative units for font size. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
