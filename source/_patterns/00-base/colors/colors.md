### Description
These are the brand-approved colors for UCSF, including tints.

### Usage
Colors are the digital or interactive versions of the UCSF Brand master palette, and provide opportunities for greater contrast in order to meet W3Câ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) AA level color contrast standards. Font size and other details still need to be considered when using colored backgrounds. Visit Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/print-digital/digital-colors">Digital Colors page</a> for precise use cases and applications.

### Accessibility Considerations
Be sure there is sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors. Ensure that color is not the only means of conveying content or information.
