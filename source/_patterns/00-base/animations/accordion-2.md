title: Accordion 
---

### Description
This is an accordion.

### Usage
Accordions should be used to compress related information that doesn't need to be displayed immediately on page load. Users can quickly navigate to content relevant to them.

### Accessibility Considerations
Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### Technical Considerations
To implement the accordion-2, use the markup structure shown here, with the class accordion-2.

Accordion 2 utilizes the jquery-accessible-accordion-aria.js library and is included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder. All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
