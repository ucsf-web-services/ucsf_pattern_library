### Description
This is hero 1.

### Usage
Hero 1 is predominantly text, so you should choose this if your introductory content is more important than any accompanying imagery. Text should be kept short and succinct, keeping in mind that a hero is designed to give a brief introduction to your site before linking a user elsewhere. The image associated with this banner style should only be a visual texture designed to create interest. Don't use imagery that will look uncomfortable cropped to a narrow area, such as a portrait or group photo. Try to choose more abstract visuals, such as architecture, cell structures or landscapes. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
