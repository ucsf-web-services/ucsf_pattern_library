### Description
This is hero 2.

### Usage
Hero 2 is text-heavy, so you should choose this if your introductory content is more important than any accompanying imagery, but you still have images that you'd like to show off. Text should be kept short and succinct, keeping in mind that a hero is designed to give a brief introduction to your site before linking a user elsewhere. Make sure to test at different screen sizes. Don't use imagery that will look uncomfortable with the left third of the photograph covered. Try to choose more abstract visuals, such as architecture, cell structures or landscapes. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
