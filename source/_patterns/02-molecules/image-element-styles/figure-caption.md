### Description
This is an image with a caption below.

### Usage
Captions are good practice, as they allow people to quickly know what's happening in a photo while allowing the photographer, illustrator or other artist to be properly attributed. Captions should be short and relate all pertinent information.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
