### Description
This is an image with a border.

### Usage
Borders allow for visual interest and consistency by bringing in color accents. They should match your site's overall color scheme.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
