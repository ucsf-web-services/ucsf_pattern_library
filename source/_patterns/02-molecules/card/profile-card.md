### Description
This is a profile card.

### Usage
A profile card displays the basic information of a single individual. They work best as a vertical series within a sidebar, or in a row with other profile cards. Care should be taken with spacing between cards.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
