### Description
This is a location card.

### Usage
Location cards can be added to any page to call attention to location information. They work best either as full-width standalone items or in two-column layouts.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
