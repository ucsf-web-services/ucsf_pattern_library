### Description
This is an accordion.

### Usage
Accordions should be used to compress related information that doesn't need to be displayed immediately on page load. Users can quickly navigate to content relevant to them.

### Accessibility Considerations
Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
