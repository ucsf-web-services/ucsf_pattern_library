### Description
These are social media sharing icons.

### Usage
Social media sharing icons are intended to sit at the top of the page, beneath the title. They should only be used for timely, news-related content that are more likely to be shared on social media. For guidelines on social media usage, visit Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/print-digital/social-media">Social Media Standards</a> page.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
