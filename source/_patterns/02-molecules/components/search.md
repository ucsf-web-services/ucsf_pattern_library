### Description
This is the search feature.

### Usage
Search functionality is critical to a site, and should always be accessible in every site's header for consistency across UCSF websites. Standard placement dictates it should remain at the upper right, beneath the navy blue banner bar.

### Accessibility Considerations
The site search feature itself should be easy to find and simple to operate. The site search feature is often most usable if it appears on every page, though there is no requirement that it do so. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
