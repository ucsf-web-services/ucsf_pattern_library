### Description
These are social media links.

### Usage
Social media links are intended to sit within the header region beside the search bar, and should only be used if your site has relevant, UCSF-branded social media accounts you are trying to promote. For guidelines on social media usage, visit Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/print-digital/social-media">Social Media Standards</a> page.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
