### Description
This is the publication teaser.

### Usage
Add publications to other areas of your site, preferably in a group of three or more.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
