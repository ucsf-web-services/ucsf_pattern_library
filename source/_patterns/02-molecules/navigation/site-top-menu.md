### Description
This is the sites top-navigation content menu.

### Usage
This top navigation menu is a required element across all UCSF websites, and must have uniform links, sizing, items and placement.

1. University of California San Francisco (Left item, link: https://www.ucsf.edu)
1. About UCSF (First item on right, link: https://www.ucsf.edu/about#active-default)
1. Search UCSF (Second item on right, link: https://www.ucsf.edu/search)
1. UCSF Medical Center (Third item on right, link: https://www.ucsfhealth.org)

Sites with an approved UCSF logo should not include the UCSF logo in the banner above (see http://neurograd.ucsf.edu for an example). Sites with an all text site title should include the UCSF logo in the banner above (see http://websites.ucsf.edu for an example).

### Accessibility Considerations
Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### Technical Considerations
The links in the molecule are intentionally left as placeholders and the proper content (links to the sites above) are included in the JSON data file, in accordance to the Pattern Library's overall approach to separating content and layout.
