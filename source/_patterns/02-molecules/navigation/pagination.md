### Description
This is an example of pagination.

### Usage
Pagination should be used on pages with a feed of items. As these items grow in number, pagination will allow a user to navigate them quickly.

### Accessibility Considerations
Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
