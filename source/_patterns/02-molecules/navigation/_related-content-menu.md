### Description
This is a related content menu.

### Usage
If you want to direct users to related items, such as a series of articles, this is one way to do so. Related items should appear after an article's main body or in the sidebar area.

### Accessibility Considerations
Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
