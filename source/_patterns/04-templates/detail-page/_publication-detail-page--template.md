For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link.

Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image.

Button color contrast and font size is important. The button description should be descriptive. Be sure to specify the type of button (button, reset, submit).
