### Description
This is a list of all publications.

### Usage
An all publications list generally rests on an individual's profile page, and only includes their specific papers. If posting on its own on a separate page, some sort of filtering is recommended, as well as navigation.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
