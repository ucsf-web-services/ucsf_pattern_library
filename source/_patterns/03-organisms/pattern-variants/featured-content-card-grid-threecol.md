### Description
This is a set of featured content cards.

### Usage
Featured content cards are a way to introduce or highlight information with a big visual splash and an accent of color. They are strongest in a two- or three- column layout with other featured content cards. While they can take an image of any aspect ratio, it's recommended that the same ratio is used for all featured content cards to maintain visual consistency.

These cards are presented with different amounts of information to show their flexibility, but on a real site, it's best to keep content roughly equivalent.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
