# Blockquote

### Description
These are examples of blockquotes.

### Usage
Blockquotes can be used on any page, and in a variety of colors and sizes. Formatting complies with UCSF Brand Guidelines, colors, and fonts. Please be aware that quotes should be kept short, and that blockquotes are meant to float left or right within a block of text.

### Accessibility Considerations
As a general statement, the more structured your document is, the easier it will be to understand, Blockquotes create structure by indenting quotes.

### Technical Considerations
Despite the fact that the blockquote element causes the text within it to be visually indented, this tag should not be used for its visual effect alone, only for a quote.
