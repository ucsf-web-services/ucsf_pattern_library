### Description
This is the multiple element sidebar.

### Usage
Multiple molecules can be added within a sidebar; spacing and style will adjust according to their placement. Sidebars should never extend past the main body content of a page.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
