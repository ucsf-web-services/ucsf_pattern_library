### Description
This is the single element sidebar.

### Usage
A single molecule can be added to a sidebar, and spacing and styling will adjust. Sidebars should never extend past the main body content of a page.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
