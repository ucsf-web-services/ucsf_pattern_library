### Description
This is the header.

### Usage
The header section rests at the top of every page. It should contain the navy blue navigation bar required for all UCSF sites, site title or logo provided by identity@ucsf.edu, social media icons (if desired), a search feature and a top navigation menu. Elements should behave responsively on smaller screens, and should be consistent across the site.

#### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

Complex menus, sliders, dialogs, tab panels, etc. must all be built to support keyboard accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

The site search feature itself should be easy to find and simple to operate. The site search feature is often most usable if it appears on every page, though there is no requirement that it do so. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
