title: Featured Publications List
---

### Description
This is a list of featured publications.

### Usage
A simple way to highlight specific publications. There should never be more than three featured at a time in a sidebar or main body area. Four publications can be used if added to a full-width page.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
