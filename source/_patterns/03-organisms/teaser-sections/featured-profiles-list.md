### Description
This is a list of featured profiles.

### Usage
A simple way to highlight specific individuals. There should never be more than three featured at a time in a sidebar or main body area. Four profiles can be used if added to a full-width page.

### Accessibility Considerations
Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including these elements, in context.

For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link.

Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image.
