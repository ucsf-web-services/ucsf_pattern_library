### Description
This is a list of latest events.

### Usage
A simple way to highlight events in chronological order. There should never be more than three featured at a time in a sidebar or main body area. Four events can be used if added to a full-width page.

### Accessibility Considerations
Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including these elements, in context.

For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link.

Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image.

Button color contrast and font size is important. The button description should be descriptive. Be sure to specify the type of button (button, reset, submit).
