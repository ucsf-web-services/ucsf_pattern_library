### Description
This is the Large Profile Image.

### Usage
Best used with flattering portraits that comply with our Brand Photography Guidelines on Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/photography-and-video/photography-standards">Photography Standards</a>. Make sure the crop doesn't cut off an area of the person's face, and try to keep the crop consistent with other profile images on the site.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
