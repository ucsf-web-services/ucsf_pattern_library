### Description
This is the Card Image.

### Usage
A card image gives a quick idea of the connected content, and can be thought of as a thumbnail. Images should be chosen carefully to look compelling at a small size.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
