### Description
This is the Event Image.

### Usage
An event image gives a quick idea of the connected content displayed as a thumbnail. Images should be chosen carefully to look compelling at a very small size, so choose photographs or other visuals that are simple in composition.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
