### Description
This is Banner Image 3.

### Usage
Banner 3 is image-heavy and takes up a large portion of the page. English users who read left-to-right will automatically take in this photo first, so it's important that chosen images have a big visual impact and contextually fit the site. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
