### Description
These are form buttons.

### Usage
Buttons should be used to call out desired actions. Colored buttons should be used on a white background, and reversed out buttons should be used on a colored background. Button text should always be short, unique and descriptive (e.g. not "Click here"). Button text should be Helvetica Neue and all caps, rather than lower case or title case. Full-width buttons are desirable for smaller areas, such as sidebars or columns. These classes can be used on an anchor tag as well as a button tag.

### Accessibility Considerations
Color contrast and font size is important. The button description should be descriptive. Be sure to specify the type of button (button, reset, submit). Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

### Technical Considerations
The class btn is the base button, adding other classes changes the background, font, and hover colors. Font size and width classes can be added to any button to change those attributes.
