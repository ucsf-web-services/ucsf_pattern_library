### Description
This is a select menu.

### Usage
If you have a long list of options but a limited amount of space, a select menu is a good stylistic choice. Users can only select one item at a time, so it should only be used for questions that require a single answer. Text for each choice should be roughly the same length, and kept as short as possible.

### Accessibility Considerations
It is recommended that multiple select menus be avoided. Not all browsers provide intuitive keyboard navigation for multiple select menus. Many users do not know to use CTRL/Command or Shift + click to select multiple items. Typically, a set of check box options can provide similar, yet more accessible functionality. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

The Select Menu utilizes the jquery-ui.min.js library and is checked into GIT. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor-compiled/jquery-mui.min.js file. All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
