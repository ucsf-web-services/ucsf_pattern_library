### Description
These are the color combinations.

### Usage
The UCSF Brand palette is split into primary and secondary applications. When thinking of color combinations, think of selecting one color from the primary palette, and another from the secondary palette. Other combinations are possible.

### Accessibility Considerations
Be sure there is sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.
Ensure that color is not the only means of conveying content or information.
