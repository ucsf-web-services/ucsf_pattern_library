### Description
Thia is a horizontal line.

### Usage
Horizontal lines should be used to differentiate sections or elements, and be consistently used across the site.

### Accessibility Considerations
The HTML hr element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. It may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, but is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms.

There are no specific requirements for accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.

<!-- ### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
To implement horizontal line, use the markup structure shown here, with the hr tag. -->
