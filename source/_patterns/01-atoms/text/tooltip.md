title: Tool Tip
---

### Description
This is a tooltip.

### Usage
If a user might need more guidance on an item, you can add a tooltip.

### Accessibility Considerations
Tooltips should become visible to sighted keyboard users when the control has keyboard focus, not just when the user hovers or clicks with a mouse. Ensure the Tooltip conveys all the information that a screen reader user would need. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
