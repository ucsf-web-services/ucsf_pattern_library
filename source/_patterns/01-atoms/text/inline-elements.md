### Description
These are examples of inline elements.

### Usage
Inline elements should be used sparingly, and only as required, to further emphasize information. They should never be used for display only, but to describe the content they surround, e.g. em and strong are used to emphasize a bit of text and should not be used in the place of a heading tag.

### Accessibility Considerations
Generally, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements. An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element. There are no specific requirements for accessibility. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
