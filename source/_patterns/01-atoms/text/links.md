### Description
These are examples of links.

### Usage
Hyperlink blue should stay consistent across the site to help a user understand how to navigate. The blue has been selected to heighten contrast levels and complies with the UCSF Brand color palette's specifications. Hyperlinks on dark backgrounds are white.

### Accessibility Considerations
For screen readers, links should make sense out of context. Make sure the linked text is what they will get when clicked, please <strong>never</strong> use "Click here" text. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
