### Description
These are examples of paragraphs.

### Usage
Paragraphs should be left-aligned and ideally be narrower than the full width of a page to make them easier to read. Larger paragraphs should be broken into smaller ones whenever possible to encourage scanning.

### Accessibility Considerations
Screen readers pause for paragraph endings. When possible, place the distinguishing information of a paragraph in the first sentence. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
