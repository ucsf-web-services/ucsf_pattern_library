### Description
This is Banner Image 1.

### Usage
Banner 1 is predominantly text, so the image is essentially only texture used to create visual interest. Don't use imagery that will look uncomfortable cropped to a narrow area, such as a portrait or group photo. Try to choose more abstract visuals, such as architecture, cell structures or landscapes. A variety of images are available in the Brand Photo Library, accessible through MyAccess.

### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
