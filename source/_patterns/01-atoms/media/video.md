### Description
This is a video.

### Usage
It's recommended that the site admin upload the video to a third-party host such as Youtube or Vimeo prior to embedding. Guidelines for video production can be found at Identity's <a href="https://identity.ucsf.edu/photography-video/video-standards">Video Standards</a>.

### Accessibility Considerations
In order to be fully accessible to the maximum number of users, web multimedia should include both synchronized captions AND a descriptive transcript.  Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
