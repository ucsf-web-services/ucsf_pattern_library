# Utility Examples

## Description
Through development, you may need to add padding or other layout utilities to your structures. These classes provide a consistent way to apply padding and, if required in the future, can be changed globally.

## Usage
Elements should sit comfortably away from one another so that a page's contents don't appear cramped or illegible.
